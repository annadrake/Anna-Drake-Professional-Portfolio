  <h2>Holistic Well-Being &amp; Self-Care</h2>
  <p>
    Self-care, for me, is not a checklist or a trend; it is a survival skill and a professional responsibility.
    My ability to offer grounded, compassionate, and ethical care depends on how well I tend to my own mind, body, and spirit.

    <h3>The Ocean as a Grounding Place</h3>
    <p>
      The ocean has always been my anchor. I visit often because I relate to its changing character—soft and gentle one day,
      fierce and determined the next. The ocean mirrors my lived experience and reminds me that strength and vulnerability
      can coexist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being near the water helps me think through difficult decisions, process emotions, and reconnect with myself and the wider world.
      It is a place of restoration, clarity, and perspective.

  <h3>Integrative Health &amp; Yoga</h3>
  <p>
    My MA in Integrative Health &amp; Healing exposed me to natural and energy medicine, psycho-neuroimmunology,
    spirituality and health, and a wide range of complementary therapies. My thesis focused on auricular acupuncture for
    service members with polytrauma syndrome, reflecting my interest in trauma-informed, somatic approaches to healing.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a Registered Yoga Teacher trained in Germany, I use yoga as both a personal and professional tool—supporting nervous
    system regulation, embodiment, and gentle, accessible movement. My practice emphasizes non-harm, balance, and compassion,
    values that also guide my work with patients and families.
