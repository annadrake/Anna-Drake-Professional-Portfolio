  <p>
    MOB Family grew out of my lived experience as a military spouse raising children in Germany, navigating pregnancy, birth,
    and postpartum care within the TRICARE Overseas system and the German midwifery-led model of care.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Germany, postpartum home visits from midwives are standard. After each birth, a midwife came to my home to assess my healing,
    support breastfeeding, check my newborn’s weight and wellbeing, and offer reassurance. This gentle, relational care contrasted sharply
    with what most American families—and especially military families—receive.

  <h3>Mission</h3>
  <p>
    MOB Family exists to strengthen postpartum and family support for U.S. military families stationed overseas by:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advocating for enhanced, culturally sensitive postpartum care within TRICARE Overseas</li>
    <li>Providing education and resources for parents navigating host-nation systems</li>
    <li>Building community among military families experiencing pregnancy and early parenting abroad</li>
    <li>Highlighting evidence-based models of care, including midwifery-led and home-based support</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h3>Who We Serve</h3>
  <p>
    MOB Family primarily serves:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pregnant and postpartum military spouses living overseas</li>
    <li>Families adjusting to new cultures, languages, and healthcare systems</li>
    <li>Parents navigating deployments, reintegration, and early parenting</li>
    <li>Those at risk for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders who need early support and continuity</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Vision</h3>
  <p>
    I envision TRICARE Overseas as a testing ground for improved postpartum support models that can eventually inform domestic insurance
    systems as well. By beginning with a defined population—military families stationed abroad—we can pilot, evaluate, and refine care
    approaches that honor both evidence and lived experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    MOB Family is one expression of that vision: a bridge between systems, cultures, and the everyday realities of parenthood.
