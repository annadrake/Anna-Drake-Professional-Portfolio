  <h2>Global Outreach &amp; Medical Anthropology</h2>
  <p>
    My professional practice has been shaped by global experiences in the Dominican Republic, Ghana, and Peru. Each setting offered
    a different perspective on how geography, culture, economics, and history influence health and access to care. These journeys
    strengthened my commitment to equity and deepened my belief that good healthcare must be attentive to context.

  <h3>Dominican Republic – Rural Mountain Clinics</h3>
  <p>
    In the Dominican Republic, I joined outreach teams serving remote mountain communities. We traveled over steep, rocky terrain to
    reach families whose access to formal healthcare was intermittent at best. In that landscape, the act of simply arriving with
    supplies and clinical skills was meaningful—but the work also highlighted the importance of local knowledge and community networks.
  </p>
  <p>
    These clinics revealed both the resilience of families who had long relied on one another and the structural barriers that limited
    consistent care. The experience reinforced my understanding of how geography, infrastructure, and policy intersect at the level
    of everyday life.

  <h3>Ghana – Fertility and Nutrition Education</h3>
  <p>
    In rural Ghana, I worked in partnership with the NGO Global Mamas and U.S. Military Academy cadets completing cultural immersion
    training. Together, we facilitated conversations with women about fertility awareness, nutrition in pregnancy, and breastfeeding.
    I brought my five-year-old daughter with me, believing that exposure to service and cross-cultural connection is a powerful education.
  </p>
  <p>
    These gatherings took place in circle—rooted in dialogue rather than lecture. The work reinforced my appreciation for community-based
    education, the wisdom carried by local women, and the creative ways families adapt in the face of limited resources.

  <h3>Peru – Indigenous Healing Traditions</h3>
  <p>
    As part of my integrative health studies, I traveled to Peru’s Sacred Valley to learn from Indigenous healers (curanderos) and to
    participate in rituals such as despacho offerings. These ceremonies emphasized reciprocity, gratitude, and right relationship
    with land and community.
  </p>
  <p>
    While my practice is grounded in evidence-based care, these experiences reaffirmed that healing is more than a set of interventions;
    it is also about meaning, connection, and belonging. The Sacred Valley became, for me, a place where landscape, spirituality, and
    health were inseparable.
