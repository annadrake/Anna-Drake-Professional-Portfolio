    <h2>A Life of Global Service & Human Connection</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my Professional Practice Portfolio. This collection reflects my work in maternal and family health,
      global outreach, military family advocacy, integrative wellness, and compassionate leadership.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey has taken me from rural mountain clinics in the Dominican Republic, to maternal-health teaching in Ghana,
      to healing traditions in Peru’s Sacred Valley, to raising my children in Germany as a military spouse. These experiences
      shape my understanding of care, culture, systems, and human resilience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although my clinical foundation began in nursing in 2008, my identity is rooted in medical anthropology and the belief
      that health is inseparable from the environments, relationships, and cultural frameworks in which people live.
