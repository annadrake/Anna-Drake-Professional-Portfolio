  <p>
    MOB Family grew out of my lived experience as a military spouse raising children in Germany, navigating pregnancy, birth, and postpartum
    care within both TRICARE Overseas and the German midwifery-led model. It is, at its heart, an effort to bring the best of these worlds
    together on behalf of families who often feel unseen.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Germany, postpartum home visits from midwives are standard. After each birth, a midwife came to my home to assess my healing, support
    breastfeeding, check my newborn’s weight and well-being, and offer reassurance. This gentle, relational care contrasted sharply with what
    many American families—and especially military families—receive. It felt like being “mothered” as I mothered my children.

  <h3>Germany as a Living Classroom</h3>
  <p>
    Living in Wiesbaden turned my everyday life into a kind of ongoing fieldwork—observing how German midwives, obstetricians, and community
    supports surrounded families in the perinatal period, and how American systems either aligned or fell short. These contrasts became the
    foundation for my desire to transform postpartum care for military families.

  <h3>Vision</h3>
  <p>
    I envision TRICARE Overseas as a place where ideas can be tested, refined, and humanized—a living laboratory for postpartum care that
    respects cultural wisdom while honoring modern standards of safety and continuity. By beginning with a defined population—military
    families stationed abroad—we can pilot, evaluate, and refine approaches that may eventually inform domestic insurance systems as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    MOB Family is one expression of that vision: a bridge between systems, cultures, and the everyday realities of parenthood.
