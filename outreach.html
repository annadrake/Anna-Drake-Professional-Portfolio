  <h2>Global Outreach &amp; Medical Anthropology</h2>
  <p>
    My professional practice has been shaped by fieldwork and service in the Dominican Republic, Ghana, and Peru. Each setting offered
    a different perspective on how geography, history, culture, and economics influence health and access to care. These experiences
    strengthened my commitment to health equity and deepened my belief that effective healthcare must be culturally and contextually grounded.

  <h3>Dominican Republic – Rural Mountain Clinics</h3>
  <p>
    In the Dominican Republic, I worked with an interdiscplinary team and the Peace Corp to provide care in remote mountain communities. We often traveled across challenging terrain to          reach families whose access to healthcare was limited and unpredictable. While the delivery of supplies and clinical support was critical, the work also illuminated the indispensable role of       local knowledge, relationships, and community-based systems of care.

  <h3>Ghana – Fertility and Nutrition Education</h3>

  <p>
    In rural Ghana, I accompanied United States Military Academy cadets engaged in cultural immersion training and collaborated with the NGO Global Mamas. In service to the local community, I designed and delivered maternal health education focused on fertility and nutrition during pregnancy and the postpartum period. I also brought my five-year-old daughter with me, believing that early exposure to service, cultural humility, and cross-cultural connection is a powerful form of education.  </p>

  <p>
    This work required a culturally responsive approach that respected gender norms, acknowledged a blended landscape of spiritual and biomedical healthcare belief systems, and accounted for pervasive economic hardship. Because most families could not afford specialized foods or supplements, nutritional education was intentionally adapted to the local food system—ensuring that recommendations were both culturally grounded and economically attainable.

  <h3>Peru – Indigenous Healing Traditions</h3>
  <p>
  In the Quechua region of Peru, I learned from traditional Andean healers known as Hampiq, who use ritual, prayer, and offerings to connect with the spiritual dimensions of healing. Their work often centered on despacho, a ceremonial offering to Pachamama (Mother Earth), and limpia, a spiritual cleansing ritual using herbs to restore balance. The offerings themselves reflected a deep ethic of reciprocity — healing not as one-way taking, but as a mutual exchange between people, land, and spirit.
</p>

<p>
  These ceremonies were frequently performed at ancient archaeological sites or after hikes into the Andes, places shaped by centuries of ancestral spiritual practice. Witnessing healing in these sacred landscapes transformed my understanding of health, showing me that illness is not only a biomedical experience, but also a spiritual and relational one, deeply connected to nature, ancestry, and meaning.
