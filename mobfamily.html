    <p>
      Military Overseas Birth & Family Center (MOB Family) grew out of my lived experience as a military spouse raising a family in Germany, navigating pregnancy, birth, and postpartum care through TRICARE Overseas and within a host-nation health system. MOB Family stands at the intersection of German and American models of care, midwifery- and obstetric-led practices, cultural and linguistic distinctions, and the everyday realities of parenthood abroad.    </p>

  <h3>Germany as a Living Classroom</h3>
  <p>
    Living in Wiesbaden became an immersive education in perinatal systems of care. I observed how German midwives and community-based supports provide a continuum of care during pregnancy and postpartum, while American systems, particularly within military care, frequently revealed gaps. These constrasts inspired me to create a more responsive, culturally informed model of perinatal care for military families.

  <h3>Vision</h3>
  <p>
    I envision MOB Family as a platform where innovative ideas can be piloted, evaluated, and humanized, in particular, with the development of a comprehensive model of postpartum support that extends into the fourth trimester. This model honors cultural wisdom while upholding modern standards of safety and continuity. By shifting the standard of postpartum care within a defined population — military families stationed abroad — we can rigorously test and refine approaches that may ultimately inform domestic insurance and care-delivery systems.  </p>
