  <h2>About Anna</h2>
  <p>
    I have been a nurse since 2008, with experience spanning mother–baby care, hospice, orthopedics, behavioral health,
    case management, and community outreach. Over 17 years, my work has increasingly focused on maternal and family health,
    particularly in the context of military life and global settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Academically, I hold a BA in Sociology and an MA in Integrative Health &amp; Healing. My graduate studies deepened my understanding
    of mind–body–spirit connections, complementary and integrative therapies, and the role of spirituality, ritual, and environment in healing.
    I am also a Registered Yoga Teacher trained in Germany and an International Certified Childbirth Educator.
  </p>
  <p>
    Personally and intellectually, my core interest has always been medical anthropology. I see myself as a social scientist in mind,
    an advocate at heart, and a practitioner in my daily work. Even when functioning in a traditional nursing role, I interpret healthcare
    through an anthropological lens—examining how culture, policy, history, and power shape experiences of birth, illness, and healing.

  <h3>Why I Returned to Complete My BSN</h3>
  <p>
    Although I started practice with an associate degree in nursing and later completed integrated graduate work,
    I did not feel strongly compelled to complete a BSN until after living overseas as a military spouse in Germany.
    There, I experienced midwifery-led care and postpartum home visits that stood in stark contrast to typical American care models.
  </p>
  <p>
    Navigating pregnancy, birth, and postpartum recovery within the TRICARE Overseas system revealed significant gaps in continuity,
    postpartum support, and maternal mental health resources. These experiences clarified my desire to pursue a DNP, specialize as a
    Psychiatric–Mental Health Nurse Practitioner, and contribute to research on enhanced postpartum care for military families.

  <h3>Family, Service, and Intergenerational Impact</h3>
  <p>
    My children have been part of my professional journey from the beginning. One of my daughters traveled with me to Ghana at five years old
    while I taught fertility and nutrition in rural communities; she is now an ROTC cadet, continuing a legacy of service.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a mother, I have experienced three different types of births—freestanding birth center, home birth, and hospital birth—in both
    American and German systems. I have also worked as a postpartum mother–baby nurse. These combined perspectives—as patient, parent,
    provider, and military spouse—shape my advocacy for more equitable, humane, and holistic care.
