    A portfolio is more than a collection of work; it is a map of where I have been and the ideas that continue to guide me.
    Across clinical practice, global outreach, motherhood, travel, and study, I have moved through spaces that have shaped how I
    understand care — the victories, the voids, the possibilities, and the profound human impact. This portfolio gathers those threads.
    It reflects the questions that continue to inspire me and the vision I carry for how we might better support those
    who navigate birth, healing, and family life around the world.
  </p>
  <p><strong>
    This portfolio explores how culture, care systems, and lived experience shape birth, healing, and family life across the world.

    <h2>A Life of Global Service &amp; Human Connection</h2>

    <p>
      My work lives at the intersection of global health, maternal wellness, and advocacy for military families. It is shaped by
      direct patient care, healthcare education, integrative health exploration, and the lived experience of raising children within
      military and cross-cultural systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      While community health outreach has taken me to rural clinics in the Dominican Republic, remote villages in Ghana,
      and Indigenous fieldwork in Peru, my broader travels extend across Western and Eastern Europe, North Africa, the Levant,
      and Russia. Across these landscapes, I have studied not only healthcare — but how language, ritual, policy, and history shape
      how people live, suffer, and heal.
    </p>

    <p>
      This portfolio is not a résumé. It is a record of how movement through the world became movement toward a mission.
