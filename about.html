  <h2>About Anna</h2>
  <p>
    I have been a nurse since 2008, with experience spanning mother–baby care, hospice, orthopedics, behavioral health, case
    management, and community outreach. Over seventeen years, my work has increasingly centered on maternal and family health,
    particularly in the context of military life and global settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    My academic foundation is in sociology and integrative health. I hold a BA in Sociology and an MA in Integrative Health &amp; Healing,
    where I explored mind–body–spirit connections, natural and energy medicines, and the role of meaning, ritual, and environment in
    healing. My thesis focused on auricular acupuncture for service members with polytrauma syndrome, reflecting my commitment to
    trauma-informed, somatic approaches. I am also a Registered Yoga Teacher trained in Germany and an International Certified
    Childbirth Educator.
  </p>
  <p>
    Personally and intellectually, my core interest has always been medical anthropology. I see myself as a social scientist in mind,
    an advocate at heart, and a practitioner in my daily work. Even when functioning in traditional nursing roles, I interpret healthcare
    through an anthropological lens - examining how culture, policy, and power shape experiences of birth, illness, and healing.

  <h3>Global Curiosity &amp; Travel</h3>
  <p>
    Medical outreach missions have taken me to rural mountain clinics in the Dominican Republic, to community teaching spaces in Ghana, and
    to Indigenous-led healing settings in Peru’s Sacred Valley. Beyond these focused projects, I have traveled extensively throughout
    Western and Eastern Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Russia. I am drawn to ancient sites, languages, and daily rituals —
    the subtle expressions of cultural values and they inform health, family, and community.
  </p>
  <p>
    I move through these places as a social scientist at heart, observing how belief systems, societal policies, and the social determinants of 
    health influence the ways people are born, nutured, and honored. These global experiences form the deeper thread connecting my clinical work,
    my advocacy, and the vision behind MOB Family.

  <h3>Germany &amp; Military Life</h3>
  <p>
    My years living in Wiesbaden, Germany as a military spouse transformed how I understood birth, postpartum care, and the experience
    of raising children within a family-oriented culture of care. Navigating pregnancy and early parenting through both TRICARE Overseas
    and the German midwifery healthcare models revealed striking contrasts in postpartum support, mental health resources, and continuity 
    of care.

  <h3>Motherhood &amp; Midwifery-Led Care</h3>
  <p>
    As a mother, I have experienced three different types of births — freestanding birth center, home birth, and hospital birth — in both
    American and German systems. I have also worked as a postpartum mother – baby nurse. These multifacted perspectives, and as patient 
    and provider, have given me an unusually layered understanding of the strengths and limitations of different models of care.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Germany, postpartum care did not begin with a clinic appointment — it arrived at my door. Each morning, my midwife stepped quietly
    into my home, carrying the steadiness of someone who understood how delicate the first days after birth truly are. She examined my son 
    in the comfort of his own room, moving at a pace that honored his rhythm rather than disrupting it. She checked my healing with unhurried 
    patience, taught me the early work of pelvic-floor restoration, and offered simple, nourishing recipes for the weeks ahead. But what stayed 
    with me most was her presence — steady, warm, and unmistakably maternal. There was a deep, almost ancestral quality to the way she cared 
    for me, a kind of woman-to-woman tending that felt both ancient and profoundly natural. I was far from my own mother, yet what I felt was 
    not the absence of her, but the presence of something larger — a quiet, primal mothering energy that held me through those vulnerable days. 
    In that experience, I recognized a truth I wanted other American women to feel as well.  </p>
  <p>
    That experience did more than support me; it changed me. It revealed what postpartum care could be when it honors the mother as much
    as the child and planted the earliest seed of what would one day become MOB Family.
