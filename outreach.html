  <h2>Global Outreach &amp; Medical Anthropology</h2>
  <p>
    My professional practice has been shaped profoundly by global experiences in the Dominican Republic, Ghana, and Peru.
    These journeys deepened my understanding of how culture, geography, economics, and history influence health, and they
    continue to shape how I think about equity and care.

  <h3>Dominican Republic – Rural Mountain Clinics</h3>
  <p>
    In the Dominican Republic, I participated in medical outreach to underserved mountain communities, often hiking over rocky,
    uneven terrain to reach families with limited access to healthcare. We staffed rural clinics, supported local hospitals,
    and worked with community leaders to provide primary care, education, and medications.
  </p>
  <p>
    These experiences highlighted how geography itself can be a determinant of health and taught me to practice with humility,
    adaptability, and respect for local knowledge.

  <h3>Ghana – Fertility and Nutrition Education</h3>
  <p>
    In 2011, I traveled to rural Ghana to teach fertility awareness and nutrition for pregnancy and lactation in partnership with
    the NGO Global Mamas and U.S. Military Academy cadets completing cultural immersion training. I brought my five-year-old daughter,
    believing that service and global connection are powerful teachers for children.
  </p>
  <p>
    Working alongside local women, community leaders, and cadets, we facilitated conversations about maternal health, nutrition,
    and breastfeeding. These encounters deepened my appreciation for community-based education and the resilience of families
    in resource-limited settings.

  <h3>Peru – Indigenous Healing Traditions</h3>
  <p>
    As part of my integrative health studies, I traveled to Peru’s Sacred Valley to learn from Indigenous healers (curanderos) and
    participate in rituals such as despacho offerings. These practices emphasized harmony between individuals, community, land, and spirit.
  </p>
  <p>
    While my practice is grounded in evidence-based care, these experiences reinforced my belief that meaning, ritual, and connection
    to place are vital components of healing and resilience.
