  <!-- ABOUT ANNA -->
  <section class="section section-alt">
    <h2>About Anna</h2>
    <p>
      I have been a nurse since 2008, with clinical experience across mother–baby care, medical/surgical, behavioral health,
      hospice, case management, and community outreach. Over seventeen years in practice, my work has increasingly
      centered on maternal and family health, particularly at the intersections of military life, cross-cultural care, and
      global health systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      My academic foundation is in sociology and integrative health. I hold a BA in Sociology from the University of Southern
      Maine (2003) and an MA in Integrative Health and Healing (2013) from The Graduate Institute, where I studied mind–body–spirit
      connections, natural and energy medicines, and the role of meaning, ritual, and environment in healing. My graduate
      thesis examined the efficacy of auricular acupuncture for service members with polytrauma syndrome, reflecting a
      longstanding commitment to trauma-informed, somatic approaches to care. I am also a Registered Yoga Teacher (RYT 200),
      trained in Germany, and an International Certified Childbirth Educator (ICEA).
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally and professionally, my core interest has always been medical anthropology. I move through healthcare as a
      social scientist in mind, an advocate at heart, and a clinician in daily practice, asking how culture, policy, history,
      and power shape the way people experience birth, illness, suffering, and healing. This lens ultimately led to the formation
      of Military Overseas Birth and Family Center (MOB Family), a nonprofit that grew out of my years living inside U.S.
      military systems abroad and witnessing the gaps in continuity, equity, and postpartum support for families navigating
      pregnancy and early parenthood overseas. Looking ahead, I am preparing to pursue advanced practice as a psychiatric mental
      health nurse practitioner beginning in 2026, with the goal of integrating perinatal, family, and mental health care across
      complex systems of service.

  <!-- SECTION 1: MILITARY LIFE & LEGACY -->
  <section class="section">
    <h3>Military Life and Legacy of Service</h3>
    <p>
      Motherhood and military life have been inseparable threads throughout my personal and professional journey. My children
      grew up in the rhythms of military culture, attending promotion ceremonies, navigating relocations, and adjusting to the
      uncertainties of deployment cycles. Living and parenting within these structures sharpened my awareness of how systems
      shape families’ access to care, stability, and support during some of the most vulnerable periods of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, these lived experiences became inseparable from my professional work. They informed how I approached maternal
      and family health, particularly for those raising children within military systems, far from extended family and familiar
      supports. Today, that legacy continues across generations: the child who once accompanied me on medical missions now wears her
      own Army ROTC uniform. Alongside this personal lineage of service, my philanthropic and nonprofit work through MOB Family
      has become the professional expression of this history, translating contextual experience into systems-level advocacy for
      perinatal equity and continuity of care.

  <!-- SECTION 2: GERMANY AS A LIVING CLASSROOM -->
  <section class="section section-alt">
    <h3>Germany as a Living Classroom</h3>
    <p>
    Living in Wiesbaden, Germany, became an immersive education in how place and policy shape perinatal care. I witnessed
    firsthand how German systems embed continuity and prevention into everyday life: walkable communities, easy access to
    midwifery services, and a public health framework that normalizes extended postpartum support. These experiences stood in
    sharp contrast to the more fragmented, time-limited structures I had known within U.S. and military healthcare.
  </p>
  <p>
    Germany was more than a backdrop; it functioned as a living classroom. The city, our Altbau apartment, and the daily
    routes I traveled with my children all became sites of observation and reflection. It was within this environment that the
    earliest conceptual seed of MOB Family took shape, as I began to ask how the strengths of the German system could be reshaped 
    to serve military families overseas who move between U.S. and host-nation care.

  <!-- SECTION 3: MIDWIFERY-LED MODEL OF CARE -->
  <section class="section">
    <h3>Motherhood and the Midwifery-Led Model of Care</h3>
    <p>
      As a mother, I have experienced three different kinds of births — freestanding birth center, home birth, and hospital
      birth — within both American and German systems. I have also worked as a postpartum mother – baby nurse. These multifaceted
      perspectives, and as both patient and provider, have given me a layered understanding of the strengths and limitations of
      different models of care and how they shape early postpartum recovery, family integration, and long-term well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Germany, postpartum care did not begin with a clinic appointment; it arrived at my door. My Hebamme visited daily in the
      early weeks, weighing my baby, checking my healing, and offering steadiness in the quiet spaces between exhaustion and
      adjustment. The care was relational, unhurried, and rooted in the home. It honored the mother as much as the child and
      treated recovery as both a physical and emotional process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those experiences did more than support my own postpartum period; they changed the way I think about system design. The
      contrast between German midwifery-led continuity and the fragmented nature of many U.S. postpartum pathways became one of
      the earliest seeds of what would evolve into MOB Family. They continue to inform how I imagine perinatal equity,
      home-based care, and mental health support for families navigating birth and early parenting within and around military
      systems.
