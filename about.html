  <h2>About Anna</h2>
  <p>
    I have been a nurse since 2008, with clinical experience across mother–baby care, orthopedics, behavioral health, hospice, case
    management, and community outreach. Over seventeen years, my work has increasingly centered on maternal and family health,
    particularly in the context of military life and global settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    My academic foundation is in sociology and integrative health. I hold a BA in Sociology (University of Southern Maine) and an MA in Integrative Health &amp; Healing (The Graduate Institute),
    where I explored mind–body–spirit connections, natural and energy medicines, and the role of meaning, ritual, and environment in
    healing. My graduate thesis focused on auricular acupuncture for service members with polytrauma syndrome, reflecting my commitment to
    trauma-informed, somatic approaches. I am also a Registered Yoga Teacher (RYT 200) trained in Germany and an International Certified
    Childbirth Educator (ICEA).
  </p>
  <p>
    Personally and professionally, my core interest has always been medical anthropology. I see myself as a social scientist in mind,
    an advocate at heart, and a practitioner in my daily work. Even when functioning in traditional nursing roles, I interpret healthcare
    through an anthropological lens — examining how culture, policy, history, and power shape experiences of birth, death, illness, and healing.

  <h3>Global Curiosity &amp; Travel</h3>
  <p>
    My interest in international healthcare has led me to rural mountain clinics in the Dominican Republic, public health initiatives in Ghaniain villages, and Indigenous healing traditions in Peru’s Sacred Valley. Beyond these experiences, I have traveled extensively across Western and Eastern Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Russia. I am especially drawn to the subtle ways that culture shapes birth, death, health, illness, and healing experiences, and how these events are holistically interpreted within families and communities.  </p>

  <h3>Germany &amp; Military Life</h3>
  <p>
    Motherhood, Military Life & the Research That Became a Mission
My years living in Wiesbaden as a military spouse and mother reshaped how I understand pregnancy, birth, and postpartum care within military systems. Navigating maternity and early parenting through both TRICARE Overseas and Germany’s midwifery-led model of care revealed stark contrasts in continuity, mental health support, and postpartum care—differences that carry real consequences for maternal and infant outcomes.
In 2024, I expanded this inquiry through the Institute for Veteran and Military Families, where the early framework for my nonprofit began to take shape. That work has continued through my RN–BSN studies at the University of Maine at Augusta, alongside active fundraising, conference engagement, and advocacy within military and veteran communities.
At the center of this work is a systems problem: military families abroad face fragmented care across U.S. and host-nation systems during the most vulnerable periods of life. Gaps in continuity, equity, and postpartum and mental health support place mothers and infants at unnecessary risk—undermining not only family health, but long-term military readiness and mission strength.  </p>

  <h3>Motherhood &amp; Midwifery-Led Care</h3>
  <p>
    As a mother, I have experienced three different types of births—freestanding birth center, home birth, and hospital birth—in both
    American and German systems. I have also worked as a postpartum mother–baby nurse. These dual perspectives, as patient and provider,
    have given me an unusually layered understanding of the strengths and limitations of different models of care.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Germany, postpartum care did not begin with a clinic appointment—it arrived at my door. Each morning, my midwife stepped quietly
    into my home, carrying the steadiness of someone who understood how delicate the first days after birth truly are. She weighed my
    baby beside the window, checked my healing with unhurried patience, and moved through the room with a presence that felt like
    reassurance made visible. It was gentle, attentive, dignifying—care that allowed me to be both a mother and a person still becoming.
  </p>
  <p>
    That experience did more than support me; it changed me. It revealed what postpartum care could be when it honors the mother as much
    as the child and planted the earliest seed of what would one day become MOB Family.
