  <h2>Holistic Well-Being &amp; Self-Care</h2>
  <p>
    Self-care, for me, is not a luxury or a trend; it is a necessity and an ethical responsibility. The work of accompanying families
    through birth, illness, and loss requires presence, stability, and a capacity to hold complexity. My ability to offer grounded,
    compassionate care depends on how consistently I tend to my own mind, body, and spirit.

    <h3>The Ocean as a Grounding Place</h3>
    <p>
      The ocean is where I return when I need to remember myself. Its changing temperament—gentle one day, insistent the next—mirrors
      the seasons of my own life. Standing at the edge of the water, I feel the noise fall away. There is a clarity in the horizon
      line that helps me reorient, breathe more deeply, and step back into my work with a steadier heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being near the water allows me to process difficult decisions, integrate grief and hope, and reconnect with a sense of continuity
      that extends beyond any single season of practice.
    </p>

  <h3>Integrative Health &amp; Yoga</h3>
  <p>
    My MA in Integrative Health &amp; Healing allowed me to explore natural and energy medicine, psycho-neuroimmunology, spirituality and
    health, and a wide range of complementary approaches. These studies reinforced what I had already sensed in clinical work: that
    meaning, connection, and embodiment are central to healing.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a Registered Yoga Teacher trained in Germany, I use yoga as both personal practice and professional tool. My approach emphasizes
    accessibility, nervous system regulation, and gentle movement. It is less about performance and more about returning to oneself
    with kindness. The values that guide my practice—non-harm, balance, compassion—are the same values that guide my work with patients
    and families.

  <h3>Graduate Study in Integrative Health</h3>
  <p>
    At The Graduate Institute in Bethany, Connecticut (now closed), I completed coursework that explored holistic health, spirituality,
    Indigenous healing traditions, and the mind–body–spirit connection. These studies continue to inform how I think about resilience,
    burnout, and sustainable practice, both for patients and for those who care for them.

  <h3>Everyday Practices That Sustain Me</h3>
  <p>
    My self-care practices are intentionally simple and repeatable. They are less about escape and more about staying connected to myself
    and to what matters.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Walking outdoors in all seasons, especially near water</li>
    <li>Gentle yoga, stretching, and breathwork</li>
    <li>Journaling and reflective writing</li>
    <li>Setting boundaries around time, energy, and emotional labor</li>
    <li>Seeking supervision, mentorship, or therapy when needed</li>
    <li>Nurturing close relationships with my children and trusted friends</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These practices support my longevity in practice and my ability to remain present, clear, and compassionate in challenging settings.
