    A portfolio is more than a collection of work; it is a map of where I have been and the ideas that continue to guide me.
    Across clinical practice, global outreach, motherhood, travel, and study, I have moved through spaces that have shaped how I
    understand care — its gaps, its possibilities, and its profound human significance. This portfolio gathers those threads. It
    reflects not only the professional roles I have held, but the experiences that transformed me, the questions that continue
    to call me forward, and the vision I carry for how we might better support those who navigate birth, healing, and family life
    around the world.

    <h2>A Life of Global Service &amp; Human Connection</h2>
    <p>
      This portfolio traces the arc of my work at the intersection of global health, maternal wellness, and advocacy for military
      families. It reflects the integration of bedside nursing, community outreach, integrative health study, and the lived
      experience of raising children within a military system and across cultures.
    </p>
    <p>
      While medical outreach missions have taken me to make-shift clinics in the hills of the Dominican Republic, women's health 
      education in rural Ghana, and experiential field study of ancestral healing practices in Peru, my travels extend far beyond 
      those settings. Over the years I have explored Western and Eastern Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Russia, 
      drawn to language, ritual, and the subtle ways in which culture shapes how people live, suffer, and heal. I move through the 
      world as a social scientist at heart, carrying these observations back into my practice.
