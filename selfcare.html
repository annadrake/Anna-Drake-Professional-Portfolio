  <h2>Holistic Well-Being &amp; Self-Care</h2>
  <p>
  My understanding of self-care has been shaped by working across many levels of the American healthcare system, within a profit-driven culture that prioritizes productivity, efficiency, and        output. That experience has been deeply tempered by my personal and professional life abroad within European care models, as well as through sustained intercultural exploration and study.          Together, these perspectives have formed a grounded understanding of what sustainable caregiving truly requires.
  </p>

  <p>
  Self-care is multifaceted - physical, psychological, emotional, social, spiritual, and professional - and each of these functions as an interconnected reservoir. When one becomes depleted, the     others are inevitably affected. These reservoirs require continual and intentional replenishment. Self-care cannot be placated or deferred; it must be actively invested in to sustain ethical,      grounded, and compassionate practice in healing and caring fields.

    <h3>The Ocean as a Grounding Place</h3>

    <p>
      I feel a cellular connection to the ocean, perhaps rooted in my lineage, having descended from maritime people in Canada whose culture and livelihood were shaped by the sea. I return to the ocean in every season, even on a dark, stormy winter night, drawn to its shifting temperament and raw energy as a mirror of my own lived experience.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Being near the ocean helps me process difficult decisions, integrate hope and grief, and regain perspective. From this place, I am able to view my life and goals more holistically, returning to them with greater clarity and balance.

        My yoga training in Germany integrated physical and contemplative practice, including Hatha and Vinyasa movement, Pranayama breathwork, and Yoga Nidra, along with foundational study of the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita.
      </p>

      <p>
        While living there, I also practiced alongside active-duty service members in trauma-informed yoga on post through the Veterans Yoga Project, emphasizing somatic work, body scanning, and interoceptive awareness for nervous system regulation.

  <h3>Graduate Study in Integrative Health</h3>
  <p>
    At The Graduate Institute in Bethany, Connecticut (now closed), I completed coursework that explored holistic health, spirituality,
    Indigenous healing traditions, and the mind–body–spirit connection. These studies continue to inform how I think about resilience,
    burnout, and sustainable practice, both for patients and for those who care for them.

  <h3>Everyday Practices That Sustain Me</h3>
  <p>
    My self-care practices are intentionally simple and repeatable. They are less about escape and more about staying connected to myself
    and to what matters.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Walking outdoors in all seasons, especially near water</li>
    <li>Gentle yoga, stretching, and breathwork</li>
    <li>Journaling and reflective writing</li>
    <li>Setting boundaries around time, energy, and emotional labor</li>
    <li>Seeking supervision, mentorship, or therapy when needed</li>
    <li>Nurturing close relationships with my children and trusted friends</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These practices support my longevity in practice and my ability to remain present, clear, and compassionate in challenging settings.
